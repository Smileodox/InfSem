    abstract = { This essay describes the evolution of stress as a medical scientific idea. Claude Bernard, Walter B. Cannon and Hans Selye provided key founding concepts for the current view. Bernard introduced the idea of the internal environment bathing cells—the milieu intérieur—maintained by continual compensatory changes of bodily functions. Cannon coined the word, “homeostasis,” referring to a set of acceptable ranges of values for internal variables. Cannon taught that threats to homeostasis evoke activation of the sympathoadrenal system as a functional unit. Selye defined stress as a state characterized by a uniform response pattern, regardless of the particular stressor, that could lead to long-term pathologic changes. “Allostasis” was introduced as a concept in recognition that there is no single ideal set of steady-state conditions in life; instead, setpoints and other response criteria change continuously. Stress is now viewed neither as a perturbation nor a stereotyped response pattern but as a condition characterized by a perceived discrepancy between information about a monitored variable and criteria for eliciting patterned effector responses. Different stressors elicit different patterns of activation of the sympathetic nervous, adrenomedullary hormonal, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical and other effectors, closing negative feedback loops. This systems concept of stress yields predictions that observation or experimentation can test and that are applicable to normal physiology and to a variety of acute and chronic disorders. }

  abstract  = {Numerous vital signs are reported in association with stress response assessment, 
               but their application varies widely. This work provides an overview over methods 
               for stress induction and strain assessment, and presents a multimodal 
               experimental study to identify the most important vital signs for effective 
               assessment of the response to acute mental stress. We induced acute mental stress 
               in 65 healthy participants with the Mannheim Multicomponent Stress Test and 
               acquired self-assessment measures (Likert scale, Self-Assessment Manikin), 
               salivary α-amylase and cortisol concentrations as well as 60 vital signs from 
               biosignals, such as heart rate variability parameters, QT variability parameters, 
               skin conductance level, and breath rate. By means of statistical testing and a 
               self-optimizing logistic regression, we identified the most important biosignal 
               vital signs. Fifteen biosignal vital signs related to ventricular repolarization 
               variability, blood pressure, skin conductance, and respiration showed significant 
               results. The logistic regression converged with QT variability index, left 
               ventricular work index, earlobe pulse arrival time, skin conductance level, rise 
               time and number of skin conductance responses, breath rate, and breath rate 
               variability (F1 = 0.82). Self-assessment measures indicated successful stress 
               induction. α-amylase and cortisol showed effect sizes of -0.78 and 0.55, 
               respectively. In summary, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis and 
               sympathetic nervous system were successfully activated. Our findings facilitate a 
               coherent and integrative understanding of the assessment of the stress response 
               and help to align applications and future research concerning acute mental stress.}
